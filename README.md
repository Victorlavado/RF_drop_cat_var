# RF_drop_cat_var
Scrip that generates a dataframe from a given csv file (downloaded from Kaggle) to predict house prices in Melbourne by using a Random Forest Model. Data cleaning is done by droping columns with text elements.

To execute the script make sure you save the csv file in the same path as where the script is located. Otherwise you can change it simply by using an absolute path when reading the data
